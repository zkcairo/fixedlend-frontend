            <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 tracking-wider">Where Does the Yield Come From?</h4>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Borrowers want to leverage their DeFi positions. In exchange, they are willing to pay a portion of their earned yield to lenders. For example, if they have access to a 10% APR position, they can pay you a fixed 7% and still make a profit.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Lenders simply collect this yield, in a fixed and predictable manner, without needing to research the best or latest DeFi strategies themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              The collateral's value is always pegged to the borrowed asset. This design makes price fluctuations between different assets irrelevant to the protocol's stability.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Lenders Use FixedLend</h3>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">1) Deposit Your Assets</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Start by depositing the asset you want to lend (for example, ETH).
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2) Choose a Lending Strategy</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                FixedLend supports two primary strategies: One-Time or Recurring loans.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>One-Time Loan:</strong> Take the best available borrower's offer for a single, non-renewing loan. This is ideal if you want a single fixed-term engagement.
                </li>
                <li className="mt-2">
                  <strong>Recurring Loan Offer:</strong> Create a maker order that stays active on the order book. When a borrower accepts your offer, the loan is executed. After repayment, your offer automatically returns to the book, allowing you to act as a continuous liquidity provider without manual intervention.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">3) Active Loans</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Once a borrower accepts your offer, your funds are transferred and collateral is locked in the contract. You begin earning fixed yield immediately. At maturity, the borrower can repay, and you reclaim your principal plus interest. If they fail to repay on time, liquidation is available to protect your funds.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">4) Withdrawals</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                You retain full control. You can disable your recurring offers at any time to prevent new loans. Principal and earned interest can be withdrawn as soon as loans are completed or if you liquidate an eligible overdue loan.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Borrowers Use FixedLend</h3>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">1) Deposit Your DeFi Position</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Start by depositing the single-exposure DeFi position you wish to leverage (for example, fETH, a yield-bearing ETH asset).
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2) Place Offers on the Order Book</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                To borrow profitably, you should only place offers when the interest you pay is lower than the yield you earn from your DeFi position. The affordable APR depends on the loan duration and your position's current yield.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">3) Borrow the Underlying Asset</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Borrow the non-yield-bearing asset related to your collateral (for instance, borrow ETH if you deposited fETH). Currently, only ETH is supported, with more assets coming soon.
              </p>
              
              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">4) Leverage Your Position</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Use the borrowed assets to increase your DeFi position, thereby amplifying your yield. At the end of the loan term, you can renew it or unwind your leveraged position to repay the loan.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">5) Deploy Your Bots (Coming Soon)</h4>
              <p className="mt-2">
                Effective yield farming requires constant market monitoring. We will provide automated tools for this as the market matures. For now, the FixedLend team is the primary borrower, and we plan to decentralize the borrowing side as soon as possible.
